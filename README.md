# FARA Archive

This is an archive of Foreign Agent Registration Act filings and data.

[This link](https://www.documentcloud.org/projects/221099-fara-storage-public/) goes to a static archive on DocumentCloud that hosts all FARA filings, of every type, from March 22nd 2025 thru the very first filing in 1942.

- The file FARA_All_RegistrantDocs_03222025 in this repository contains a column "DocumentCloud Name," which can be used to search the archive for individual filings. The names are derived from the end of the urls that (currently) lead to the DOJ's copy of the record, and follow the format: RegistrationNumber-DocumentType-Date-MysteryExtraNumber.

- The archive currently consists of 117,968 documents. There are two missing -- I'll work to identify which those are and why they didn't upload

- Big chunks of short forms and Registration Statements from 1942-2008 aren't available on the DOJ's website and are instead listed as "Available-FARA-Public-Office" in the excel doc, and therefore aren't included in our archive

- The DocumentCLoud archive will be updated in the coming days to update with new filings on a daily basis

- The file failed_fara_downloads.csv in the repository contains a list of filings that cannot be successfully downloaded using the urls provided at FARA.gov

The datasets folder in this repository contains static datasets from 3/25/2025 from the [Browse Filings](https://efile.fara.gov/ords/fara/f?p=1381:1:1551967097995:::::) page of FARA.gov.

- These files will be updated in the coming days to update with new filings on a daily basis


The bulk_data_files folder in this repository contains the csv files available for download from the [Bulk Data](https://efile.fara.gov/ords/fara/f?p=107:21::::::) page of FARA/gov.

- These files ARE updated a minimum of once per day
